# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about SVG and performed CSS Animations on an SVG image. Followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM8eTD01UE8 

**Thoughts:** I have been planning to do this for so long. After a lot of procrastination I finally learned about svg + css. The tutorial was fairly simple and I understood a fair amount of the same. Hopefully, I can work on more animations and perhaps duplicate some that I have seen online.

### Day 4: June 20, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Form validation for the grade calculator and started the tic tac toe

**Thoughts:** The buttons shift everytime the text entered and removed, found a temporary fix for it but need to find a way to keep them in place. I did the form validation using if, else statements, need to look up others ways to do it. I need to start reading more documentation and materials to get a better understanding of things.ðŸ¤”
